"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"It's kinda like a code, yeah"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And you've been getting closer and closer"

"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"You're the kind of man who makes me sad"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And take for granted what you have"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And it would be a fine proposition"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"If I was a stupid girl"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And, yeah, I might go with it"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"If I hadn't once been just like her"

"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,11,"Left yourself in your war path"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,11,"Lost your balance on a tightrope"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,11,"Lost your mind trying to get it back"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,11,"Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,11,"Always a bigger bed to crawl into"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,11,"Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,11,"And everybody believed in you?"

"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"This is life before you know who you're gonna be"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Fifteen"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And soon enough you're best friends"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"We'll be outta here as soon as we can"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car"

"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"But I didn't know it at fifteen"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"When all you wanted was to be wanted"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"But I realized some bigger dreams of mine"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Who changed his mind and we both cried"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"You're gonna believe them"
