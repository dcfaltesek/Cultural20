"Taylor Swift","State Of Grace","Red",0.588,1,"Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
"Taylor Swift","State Of Grace","Red",0.588,1,"You called me later"
"Taylor Swift","State Of Grace","Red",0.588,1,"And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"Taylor Swift","State Of Grace","Red",0.588,1,"And I said, ""I'm sorry, too"""
"Taylor Swift","State Of Grace","Red",0.588,1,"And that was the moment I knew"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"You said it in a simple way"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"4 AM, the second day"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"How strange that I don't know you at all"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"Stumbled through the long goodbye"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"One last kiss, then catch your flight"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"Right when I was just about to fall"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"I told myself, don't get attached"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"But in my mind, I play it back"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"Spinning faster than the plane that took you"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"And this is when the feeling sinks in"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"I don't wanna miss you like this"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"I guess you're in New York today"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"I don't wanna need you this way"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"The delicate beginning rush"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"The feeling you can know so much"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"Without knowing anything at all"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"And now that I can put this down"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"If I had known what I know now"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"I never would've played so nonchalant"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"Taxi cabs and busy streets"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"That never bring you back to me"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"I can't help but wish you took me with you"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"And this is when the feeling sinks in"

"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"This is falling in love in the cruelest way"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"This is falling for you when you are worlds away"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"In New York, be here"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"But you're in London, and I break down"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"'Cause it's not fair that you're not around"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"This is when the feeling sinks in"
"Taylor Swift","Red","Red",0.602,2,"I don't wanna miss you like this"

"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And everybody knows that"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"I don't even know her"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"It's kinda like a code, yeah"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And you've been getting closer and closer"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And crossing so many lines"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And it would be a fine proposition"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"If I was a stupid girl"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"But, honey, I am no one's exception"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"This, I have previously learned"

"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And now you've got me alone, and I say"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"I just want to make sure"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"You understand perfectly"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"You're the kind of man who makes me sad"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And take for granted what you have"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And it would be a fine proposition"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"If I was a stupid girl"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And, yeah, I might go with it"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"If I hadn't once been just like her"

"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"Call a cab, lose my number"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"You're about to lose your girl"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"Call a cab, lose my number"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"Let's consider this lesson learned"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous","Red",0.705,3,"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah"

"Taylor Swift","Mine - Live/2011","Speak Now World Tour Live",0.496,2,"You put your arm around me for the first time"
"Taylor Swift","Mine - Live/2011","Speak Now World Tour Live",0.496,2,"You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter"
"Taylor Swift","Mine - Live/2011","Speak Now World Tour Live",0.496,2,"You are the best thing that's ever been mine"

"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,13,"I ran off the plane"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,13,"That July 9th"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,13,"The beat of your heart"

"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"The time we stood with our shaking hands"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"The crowds in stands went wild"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"We were the kings and the queens"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"And they read off our names"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"The night you danced like you knew our lives"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Would never be the same"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"You held your head like a hero"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"On a history book page"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"It was the end of a decade"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"But the start of an age"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Long live the walls we crashed through"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"

"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"One day, we will be remembered"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"I said, remember this feeling"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"I passed the pictures around"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Of all the years that we stood there"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"On the side-lines wishing for right now"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"We are the kings and the queens"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"You traded your baseball cap for a crown"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"When they gave us our trophies"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"And we held them up for our town"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"And the cynics were outraged"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Screaming, ""This is absurd"""
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"In ripped up jeans got to rule the world"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Long live the walls we crashed through"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you"

"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"I'm not afraid"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Long live all the mountains we moved"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"I was screaming, long live that look on your face"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"And bring on all the pretenders"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"One day, we will be remembered"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Hold on to spinning around"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Confetti falls to the ground"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"May these memories break our fall"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Will you take a moment?"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Promise me this"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"That you'll stand by me forever"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"But if, God forbid, fate should step in"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"And force us into a goodbye"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"If you have children some day"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"When they point to the pictures"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Please tell them my name"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Tell them how the crowds went wild"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Tell them how I hope they shine"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Long live the walls we crashed through"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"I had the time of my life, with you"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"Long, long live the walls we crashed through"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,14,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"

"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"There's something 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"In the middle of the parking lot, yeah"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"Oh, yeah"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"Absentmindedly making me want you"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"And I don't know how it gets better than this"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"

"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"Well, you stood there with me in the doorway"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"You pull me in and I'm a little more brave"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,1,"It's fearless"

"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"It's the morning of your very first day"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Try and stay out of everybody's way"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"For the next four years in this town"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"""You know, I haven't seen you around before."""
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"You're gonna believe them"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Well, count to ten, take it in"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"This is life before you know who you're gonna be"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Fifteen"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And soon enough you're best friends"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"We'll be outta here as soon as we can"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And you're feeling like flying"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"When the night ends"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you"

"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Makes your head spin 'round"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"But in your life you'll do things greater than"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Dating the boy on the football team"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"But I didn't know it at fifteen"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"When all you wanted was to be wanted"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"But I realized some bigger dreams of mine"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"Who changed his mind and we both cried"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"You're gonna believe them"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"I've found time can heal most anything"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"And you just might find who you're supposed to be"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,2,"La la la la la la la la la la"

"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,3,"I close my eyes, and the flashback starts"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,3,"I'm standing there"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,3,"On a balcony in summer air"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,3,"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns"
