"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"Oh, I'm scared to see the ending"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"Why are we pretending this is nothing?"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"I've never heard silence quite this loud"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"And we're not speaking"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"And I'm dying to know"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"Is it killing you like it's killing me?"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"Yeah, and I don't know what to say"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"This is looking like a contest"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"Of who can act like they care less"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"But I liked it better when you were on my side"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"The battle's in your hands now"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"But I would lay my armor down"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"If you say you'd rather love than fight"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"So many things that you wish I knew"
"Taylor Swift","The Story Of Us","Speak Now",0.543,"But the story of us might be ending soon"

"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger"

"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"You're in the car on the way to the movies"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"But don't make her drop you off around the block"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"Remember that she's getting older too"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little"

"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"And even though you want to, just try to never grow up"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"Remember the footsteps, remember the words said"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"And all your little brother's favorite songs"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"So here I am in my new apartment"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"In a big city, they just dropped me off"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"It's so much colder than I thought it would be"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"Wish I'd never grown up"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"I wish I'd never grown up"
"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up"

"Taylor Swift","Never Grow Up","Speak Now",0.714,"Oh, never grow up, just never grow up"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"There I was again tonight"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"Forcing laughter, faking smiles"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"Same old tired, lonely place"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"Vanished when I saw your face"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""Across the room your silhouette"

"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"The playful conversation starts"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"Counter all your quick remarks"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"Like passing notes in secrecy"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"And it was enchanting to meet you"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"This night is sparkling"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"Don't you let it go"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"I'm wonderstruck"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"Blushing all the way home"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"I'll spend forever"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"Wondering if you knew"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"I was enchanted to meet you"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"The lingering question kept me up"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"2AM, who do you love?"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"I wonder 'til I'm wide awake"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"And now I'm pacing back and forth"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"Wishing you were at my door"
"Taylor Swift","Enchanted","Speak Now",0.455,"I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey"""

"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"Ha, time for a little revenge"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She took him faster than you can say sabotage"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"I underestimated just who I was dealing with"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She underestimated just who she was stealing from"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She's not a saint and she's not what you think"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She's an actress, whoa"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She's better known for the things that she does"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"On the mattress, whoa"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"On the playground won't make you many friends"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"(Think about what you did)"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She's not a saint and she's not what you think"

"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"You might have him, but haven't you heard?"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"You might have him, but I always get the last word"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"Whoa, whoa-ah-oh"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She's not a saint and she's not what you think"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She's an actress, whoa (She deserved it)"

"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"I don't think you do, I don't think you do"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"Come on, show me how much better you are"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"(So much better, yeah?)"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"See you deserve some applause"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"'Cause you're so much better"
"Taylor Swift","Better Than Revenge","Speak Now",0.516,"She took him faster than you could say sabotage"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"I guess you really did it this time"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Left yourself in your war path"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Lost your balance on a tightrope"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Lost your mind trying to get it back"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Always a bigger bed to crawl into"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"And everybody believed in you?"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"It's alright, just wait and see"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Your string of lights is still bright to me"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Oh, who you are is not where you've been"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"You're still an innocent"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"You're still an innocent"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Did some things you can't speak of"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"But at night, you live it all again"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"If only you had seen what you know now then"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Before the monsters caught up to you?"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"It's alright, just wait and see"

"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"You'll have new Septembers"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Every one of us has messed up too"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Lives change like the weather"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"I hope you remember"
"Taylor Swift","Innocent","Speak Now",0.552,"Today is never too late to be brand new, oh"

"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"You and I walk a fragile line"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"I have known it all this time"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"But I never thought I'd live to see it break"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"It's getting dark and it's all too quiet"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"And I can't trust anything now"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"Whoa, holding my breath"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"Won't lose you again"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"Something's made your eyes go cold"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"I thought I had you figured out"

"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"Can't turn back now, I'm haunted"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"Stood there and watched you walk away"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"From everything we had"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"But I still mean every word I said to you"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"He will try to take away my pain"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"And he just might make me smile"
"Taylor Swift","Haunted","Speak Now",0.436,"But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead"

"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"Lit through the darkness at 1:58"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"The words that you whispered"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"For just us to know"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"You told me you loved me"

"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"I ran off the plane"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"That July 9th"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"The beat of your heart"

"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"You pull me in"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"I'm not much for dancing"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"But for you I did"

"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"Hope it's nice where you are"

"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"Forever the name on my lips"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"Forever the name on my lips"
"Taylor Swift","Last Kiss","Speak Now",0.371,"Just like our last"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"The time we stood with our shaking hands"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"The crowds in stands went wild"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"We were the kings and the queens"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"And they read off our names"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"The night you danced like you knew our lives"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Would never be the same"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"You held your head like a hero"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"On a history book page"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"It was the end of a decade"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"But the start of an age"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Long live the walls we crashed through"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"And bring on all the pretenders"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"One day, we will be remembered"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I said, remember this feeling"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I passed the pictures around"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Of all the years that we stood there"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"On the side-lines wishing for right now"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"We are the kings and the queens"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"You traded your baseball cap for a crown"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"When they gave us our trophies"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"And we held them up for our town"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"And the cynics were outraged"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Screaming, ""This is absurd"""
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"In ripped up jeans got to rule the world"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Long live the walls we crashed through"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"And bring on all the pretenders"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I'm not afraid"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Long live all the mountains we moved"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I was screaming, long live that look on your face"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"And bring on all the pretenders"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"One day, we will be remembered"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Hold on to spinning around"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Confetti falls to the ground"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"May these memories break our fall"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Will you take a moment?"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Promise me this"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"That you'll stand by me forever"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"But if, God forbid, fate should step in"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"And force us into a goodbye"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"If you have children some day"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"When they point to the pictures"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Please tell them my name"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Tell them how the crowds went wild"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Tell them how I hope they shine"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Long live the walls we crashed through"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I had the time of my life, with you"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Long, long live the walls we crashed through"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"And bring on all the pretenders"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I'm not afraid"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"Singing, long live all the mountains we moved"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"And long, long live that look on your face"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"And bring on all the pretenders"
"Taylor Swift","Long Live","Speak Now",0.418,"One day, we will be remembered"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"There's something 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"In the middle of the parking lot, yeah"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"Oh, yeah"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"Absentmindedly making me want you"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"And I don't know how it gets better than this"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"And I don't know why but with you I'd dance"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"In a storm in my best dress, fearless"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one horse town"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"You put your eyes on me"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"In this moment now, capture it, remember it"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"And I don't know why but with you I'd dance"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"In a storm in my best dress, fearless"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"Well, you stood there with me in the doorway"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"You pull me in and I'm a little more brave"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"It's fearless"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"Oh, yeah"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"And I don't know why but with you I'd dance"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"In a storm in my best dress, fearless"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"And I don't know why but with you I'd dance"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"In a storm in my best dress, fearless"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"Oh, oh"
"Taylor Swift","Fearless","Fearless",0.598,"Oh, yeah"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"It's the morning of your very first day"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Try and stay out of everybody's way"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"For the next four years in this town"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"""You know, I haven't seen you around before."""
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"You're gonna believe them"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Well, count to ten, take it in"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"This is life before you know who you're gonna be"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Fifteen"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"And soon enough you're best friends"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"We'll be outta here as soon as we can"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"And you're feeling like flying"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"When the night ends"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"You're gonna believe them"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"And when you're fifteen and your first kiss"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Makes your head spin 'round"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"But in your life you'll do things greater than"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Dating the boy on the football team"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"But I didn't know it at fifteen"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"When all you wanted was to be wanted"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"But I realized some bigger dreams of mine"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Who changed his mind and we both cried"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"You're gonna believe them"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"I've found time can heal most anything"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"And you just might find who you're supposed to be"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"La la la la la la la la la la"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"La la la la la la la la la la"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"La la la la la la"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Your very first day"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Take a deep breath, girl"
"Taylor Swift","Fifteen","Fearless",0.56,"Take a deep breath, as you walk through the doors"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"We were both young when I first saw you"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"I close my eyes, and the flashback starts"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"I'm standing there"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"On a balcony in summer air"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"See you make your way through the crowd"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"And say, ""Hello"""
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"Little did I know"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"And I was crying on the staircase"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"Begging you, ""Please don't go"", and I said"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes"""
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"So I sneak out to the garden to see you"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"So close your eyes"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"Escape this town for a little while"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"But you were everything to me"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"I was begging you, ""Please don't go"", and I said"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"

"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"It's a love story baby just say ""Yes""Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"This love is difficult, but it's real"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes"""
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"Oh, oh"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"I got tired of waiting"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"Wondering if you were ever coming around"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"My faith in you was fading"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"When I met you on the outskirts of town"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"I keep waiting for you but you never come"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"""
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone"
"Taylor Swift","Love Story","Fearless",0.622,"I love you, and that's all I really know"
